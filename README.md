# Backup copy of my Neovim configuration

This is a backup of my current Neovim config which has some cruft accumulated since before I switched from the OG Vim. Needs some serious cleanup, especially in syntax highlighting / auto-indenting areas.

## Plugins

Some are new, some have been installed since Vim-7-something-something. About to be wiped out and reinstalled via some plugin manager.

- [goyo](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim)
- [bufexplorer](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=42)
- [Rename2](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2724)
- [Tabular](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3464)
- [The NERD tree](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658)
- [vim-move](https://github.com/matze/vim-move)
- some ancient version of [vim-pandoc-bundle](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5088)? (I guess? Some files don't match with package)
- [vim-visual-multi](https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi)
- [Darcula color scheme](https://github.com/doums/darcula)

There were also bits and pieces from an old [LaTeX-Suite](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vim-latex/) version, now deleted.
